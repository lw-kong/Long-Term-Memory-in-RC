This is the repository for our preprint titled [Reservoir-computing based associative memory and itinerancy for complex dynamical attractors](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3454804/v1). We use two different approaches - index-based reservoir computer (RC) and index-free RC - to have multifunctional recurrent neural networks with complex dynamical long-term memory states.

## Training Data and RC Weights
The training data (time series of target memory states) and trained weights of reservoir computers (RC) are shared in [this OSF repository](https://osf.io/yxm2v/)) with DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/YXM2V. You may generate the data yourself using the codes we shared here in this GitHub repository).

## Codes for Generating the Training Data
They are shared under the Data folder.

## Codes for Training and Testing the Reservoir Computers (RCs)
They are shared under the Code-and-Results folder.
