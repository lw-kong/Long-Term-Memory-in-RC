# Reservoir-computing-based associative memory of complex dynamical patterns

## Data
This work's training and testing data come from many three-dimensional time series of chaotic or periodic attractors. The data files are shared in [this Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16sGvbCX4RUWLDp4v6FlXrxR0e8ZCRLgP?usp=sharing). The codes used to generate them are shared in the Data folder of this GitHub repository.

## Algorithms, Trained RC Weights, and Results
In the Codes-and-Results folder of this GitHub repository, we share the core codes and some of the trained RC weights and results of this work. The files too large to upload to GitHub are stored here with a link to the corresponding Google Drive files.
